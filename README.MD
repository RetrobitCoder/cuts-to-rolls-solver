# Cuts to Rolls Solver
- Uses the weighted Knapsack algorithm to solve for optimizing rolls to cuts
- Algorithm processes rolls in order from top to bottom, and assumes higher up the list, the more important
- Solution is printed out in the area shown in the green box
- Cuts and Rolls rows are inputted as FEET.INCHES
    - The process will handles inches over 12
